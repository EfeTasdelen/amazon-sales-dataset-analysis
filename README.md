# Amazon Sales Dataset Analysis using the OSEMN Framework

This project applies the **OSEMN data science framework** to analyze the **Amazon Sales Dataset**.  
The goal is to explore how **discounts, ratings, and product popularity** relate to one another.

## Framework Overview
The OSEMN framework ensures a structured, reproducible data analysis process:

1. **O â€“ Obtain:** Load and understand the dataset from Kaggle  
2. **S â€“ Scrub:** Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.)  
3. **E â€“ Explore:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize relationships  
4. **M â€“ Model:** Quantify relationships between discount, rating, and rating count  
5. **N â€“ Interpret:** Summarize insights and practical implications
